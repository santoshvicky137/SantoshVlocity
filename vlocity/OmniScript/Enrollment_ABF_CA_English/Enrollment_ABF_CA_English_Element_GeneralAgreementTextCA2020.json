Anthem will honor Do Not Call requests for all telephone numbers collected.<br /><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;To provide notice of applicable conversion rights and rights to continue health coverage under COBRA to eligible employees and eligible dependents.<br /><strong>6.&nbsp;</strong>To pay Anthem by the premium due date, the premiums on behalf of each member covered under the contract, unless otherwise stated in any financial agreement between the parties, to submit applications of employees prior to their date of eligibility, to keep all necessary records regarding membership, to assume responsibility for handling the COBRA and state-mandated continued group coverage and/or conversion process, if applicable.<br /><strong>7.&nbsp;</strong>If applicable, employer will receive on behalf of members, all notices delivered by Anthem, and immediately forward such notices to persons involved, at their last known address.<br /><strong>8.&nbsp;</strong>We understand and agree that no coverage will be effective before the date determined by Anthem and that such coverage will be effective only if we have paid our first month&rsquo;s premium and this application is accepted.<br /><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;That in order for Anthem to accept or decline this application, all the information requested on this application must be completed. In the event the application is not complete, Anthem, or its designated agent(s), is authorized to obtain the necessary information and to complete that information on this application. If the application is not complete, Anthem reserve(s) the right to reject it and notify us in writing.<br /><strong>10.&nbsp;</strong>The employer understands that the coverage issued by Anthem may be different then the coverage applied for herein. In that event, Anthem Blue Cross Life and Health Insurance Company shall notify the employer of such differences, and by payment of the appropriate premiums, the employer will accept the coverage as issued.<br /><strong>11.&nbsp;</strong>The premium rates calculated for the employer are contingent, based upon the accuracy of the eligibility data submitted on employees and covered dependents to Anthem by the employer. Anthem reserves the right to review such rates upon receipt of all individual applications for employers&rsquo; employees and to modify the rates, if the enrollment information so warrants. Any fraud or intentional misrepresentation of material fact on the employees&rsquo; applications may, within the first 24 months following the issuance of the coverage, result in a material change to the group&rsquo;s coverage or premium rates as of the effective date of the group coverage.<br /><strong>12.&nbsp;</strong>The entire application for Group coverage has been reviewed, and all answers contained herein are true and complete to the best of the employer&rsquo;s and/or authorized representative&rsquo;s knowledge and belief.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>13</strong>.

The IRS has not yet issued HSA or high&mdash;deductible health plan regulations or determined that Anthem high-deductible plans are qualifying high-deductible health plans. Consultation with a tax advisor is recommended.<br /><strong>17.</strong>&nbsp;If we decide to cancel our group coverage after coverage has been issued, we understand that the cancellation will become effective on the last day of the month in which Anthem received the written notification of cancellation, and that no premiums will be refunded for any period between Anthem&rsquo;s receipt of the notification and the last day of the month when the cancellation takes effect. If there are any premiums after the cancellation date, we understand that Anthem will refund these premiums after 45 days from the premium deposit date.<br /><strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;We further understand and agree that we should keep prior coverage in force until notified of acceptance in writing by Anthem and that no agent has the right to accept this application or bind coverage.<br /><strong>19.</strong>&nbsp;If this application is accepted, it becomes a part of our contract with Anthem</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>HIV TESTING PROHIBITED: California law prohibits an HIV test from being required or used by health insurance companies as a condition of obtaining health insurance.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p>",
